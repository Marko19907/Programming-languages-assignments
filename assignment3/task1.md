## Task 1 b)

_What are the values of X1, X2, and RealSol, when A = 2, B = 1 and C = -1?_ <br/>
_What are the values of X1, X2, and RealSol, when A = 2, B = 1 and C = 2?_

Answered in the oz code and the output is as follows:

```oz
{QuadraticEquationHelper 2.0 1.0 ~1.0} % 0.5 -1
{QuadraticEquationHelper 2.0 1.0 2.0}  % No real solution
```


## Task 1 c)

_Why are procedural abstractions useful?_

Procedural abstractions are useful because they allow us to reuse code. This allows us to write less code and it also allows us to write more readable code while also hiding the implementation details of the procedure which is again useful because it allows us to change the implementation details of the procedure without having to change the code that uses the procedure.


## Task 1 d)

_What is the difference between a procedure and a function?_

A procedure is a piece of code that does not return a value while a function is a piece of code that does return a value. A function can be seen as a special case of a procedure.
