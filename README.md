# Programming Languages assignments

This repository the assignments for the Programming Languages (TDT4165) course at NTNU. 
The course is taught in Oz, a multiparadigm programming language.

Each assignment is in its own folder, and each folder contains a PDF with the assignment text and the solution in Oz.

## Installing Oz and Mozart locally

To run the code, you need to install Oz, Mozart, and Emacs. The VS Code plugin is optional, but strongly recommended.
A guide for installing everything for all major operating systems can be found [here](/tools_configuration.pdf).
The guide also contains instructions for running Oz in Docker if that is preferred.
